# Emojify - from Jupyter Notebook to Docker Container

A sample production implementation of an emojify api based on a NLP model using RNN (LSTM).
Idea and architecture of the model is taken from the labs of the coursera specialization course "Deep Learning" by Prof Andrew Ng.
The model was initially built,trained and tested on a Jupyter Notebook.
This project was meant to put the model to production as an API. 


### Emojification - what it is?

Emojification is attaching an emoji to a sentence that is entered by the user. 

The following emojis are used for our project for basic emojification:
    Heart
    Baseball
    Smile
    Disappointed
    Food

Input sentence is assigned one of the above emoji's

Eg:
Input = i love being lazy
Output = i love being lazy ‚ù§Ô∏è!

Input = This is so miserable
Output = This is so miserable üòû!

### Design of Model

1. An input sentence is converted to an embedding vector using Glove embedding.
Max length of input sentence is 10.

2. A custome embedding layer is implemented in Keras.
The mapping of a word to its Glove embedding is maintained in a dictionary word_to_vec_map and is stored
as a pickle file. The Glove file reader and embedding pickle file generator is in pickle_glove_embedding.py

3. LSTM is implemented in Keras to build model.
 Input = Sentence with Words
 Layer 1 = Generate word embeddings using customer word embedding above
 Layer 2 = LSTM with 128 units, all hidden units returned to next layer
 Layer 3 = Dropout regularization with p=0.5
 Layer 4 = LSTM with 128 units, only last unit (last time step) returned
 Layer 5 = Dropout egularization with p=0.5
 Layer 6 = Softmax for multiple classification


4. Model is trained with Adam optimizer and Loss = categorical_crossentropy to support multi class classification

5. With a small data set, approx 85% accuracy is achieved.

Model building and training is in the file emojify_lstm_train.py

### Deployment in Docker

A Flask app is created to support access in two ways :
  > As a web form to take user input (single sentence) and show emojified versioning
  > As an API exposing the prediction function for an input sentence

The app is then boxed into a Docker image and pushed to docker hub repository.

Image details:

    Image name - jchowdhury/emojify:v1
